2.1.2 Puts Housekeeping and System items in a sub-menu 13-07-2013
2.1.3 Minor correction in initialisation of cumulative data and layout/comments improved 14-07-2013
2.2.0 Start of implementing some form of response to exceeding data limits - termed crisis management
2.2.1 Crisis Management flag and 'terminal command' to be run now in Settings Panel.
2.2.2 Facility for two preset scripts in addition to string added. Right click menu has additional housekeeping functions to edit and test these scripts added.  
2.2.3 Addition documentation
2.2.4 Changed 'crisis' to 'suspend' for preset script and tested. Reorder advanced functions and added separators.
2.2.5 Three special cases now in use - suspendscript, alertscript and modalalert. Function added to implement the modal dialog used by modal alert. Testing functions still 'exposed' to users on right click function submenu. 
To think about - do we need the ability to have a terminal command option as any terminal command can be put into the alertScript file, in fact it can be a series of commands run asyncronously by ending them with a $ so a sound file could be played and a notification put up using zenity at the same time. This is a safer way ahead whilst leaving a huge flexibility for customisation. Should a different selection mechanism be used? 
Conclusion - change to a drop down selection of options, initially the three currently in use but consider adding sound and notification options. remove terminal string option as it can be in a script file.
2.2.6 Implemented drop down alert handling plus change back to KB from kB and replace round with floor
2.2.7 Scripts commented and checked. Extra options of notify and do nothing added. Use now made of Sox to play audio warnings and notify-send to add notifications. sox needs to be installed
2.2.8 Beautified at http://jsbeautifier.org/

2.3.3 Quick fix to background colours to use transparency so they work with light and dark themes 02-09-2013
2.3.4 Addition of radiused borders to background to improve appearance
2.3.5 Major change in use of css styles for the background colours which show connection and alert status.
      This allows the user to match colours etc to a particular theme.
2.3.6 Minor bug fix - Context Menu not always rebuilt after adding or removing advanced functions submenu.
2.3.7 Bug fix - Cummulative counters 1 and 3 not being saved correctly
2.3.8  Anomoly fix - Avoid calling  GTop.glibtop_get_netload() without valid interface -
       possible latest versions can segfault if interface not valid.
2.3.9  Add fix for Applet not being fully halted when removed from panel (from dansie)
2.3.10 Fudge to make NUMA behave the same for Cinnamon 1.8 and 2.0 by removing the
       automatically added items from the context menu by calling rebuilding menu a second 
       time during startup sequence after a one cycle delay. Long term solution is to use 
       dansie's method of building everything as a submenu. 
2.3.11 Default settings changed to start with cummulative monitoring off for all interfaces
       (null) in settings file.
2.3.12 Revert to the old method of handling cumulative data and only update cumulative totals
       for the monitored interface. Slightly less flexible but intended to reduce the chances
       of segfaults until the problem is understood and resolved.
2.3.13 Changes to Settings File to explicitely use real numbers for Cumulative Data
2.3.14 Test of reset function including setting reset date and time 
       and avoid use of updating a Cinnamon Settings within a single expression
       NB Interface 1 only 
       TEST at 10x speed - remember to reset!!!
2.3.15 Now reset function on all 3 interfaces which also avoids use of updating a Cinnamon Settings
       within a single expression on all interfaces.
       Display simplified in left click menu to format of: interface - reset date and time - Cumulative data
       ie now a single line for each interface.
       Settings file changed to use generic bidirectional where interfaces are set from applet and defaults changed
       Reset to run at correct speed 
       UPLOADED VERSION 10 March 2014.
2.3.16 Try delaying cumulative updates into cinnamon-settings by using two mainloop timers.
       Bug fix for when no default interface specified and default unchecked in settings.
       Some default settings changed in settings-schema
2.3.17 Some changes so cinnamon-settings values of cumulative total are only updated when changed in second part of loop
       Added interface name to reset menu item and rebuildFlag to on_interface_settings_changed()
       Changed 'Settings' to 'Configure' in Context Menu for consistency with Cinnamon 2.0
2.4.0  Changes to automatically select first active interface at start-up But Only If a default interface was not specified 
       and the last interface was not PPP0.
       Added explanatory text to settings-schema.json comment for the useDefaultInterface flag
2.4.1  Moved Configure to bottom of context menu
       Tried multiple instances - useful but automatic update fails and hand crafting of .cinnamon/configs/netusagemonitor@pdcurtis required
       Checked with Cinnamon 2.2 via LiveUSB
2.4.2  Display of Header inhibited when no Cummulative Data being displayed.
2.4.3.0   Multiple instances in metadata.json
          Changes to minimise width of applet when not connected to go with multiple instances.     
          Change to width in stylesheet.css to match
          New function to pad and center output to remove jitter rather use styles.
2.4.3.1   General tidy up of commented out code 
2.4.3.2   Add an offset which is set in settings but is also cleared by reset of usage
          Display includes offset when in use.
          Currently only available on Cumulative Data Usage 1
          Continue tidy up
2.4.3.3   Width padding corrected for display resolution
          Offsets on all available Cumulative Data Usage channels
2.4.3.4   Changed space character to \u2007 which has an equivalent width to a number
2.4.3.5   Added a call to buildContextMenu on left click to set up after a connection has changed.
2.4.3  Above all compressed into a single commit from above branch created in development branch
2.4.4  Removal of some commented out text and change log updated
2.4.4.1   Changes in padding and in width calculation for compact display
2.4.4.2   Modified functions for formatSpeed and formatSentReceived to extend to [B,] GB and TB and make consistent
2.5.0  Version with single instance but all other enhancements in preparation for upload
          max-instance changed in metadata.json to 1 to hopefully avoid need for hand crafting of
          .cinnamon/configs/netusagemonitor@pdcurtis  
          Changes to totalLimit and alertPercentage in settings-schema.json. 
          Tested with Cinnamon 2.4.0
          Updates to changelog.
2.6.0  Added support for Android Bluetooth tethered connections which use device bnep1 under Mint 17
          Duplicated code for ppp0 using bnep0 in three places
          Required because selecting the active bluetooth connection which looks like 12:34:56:78:90:12
          in the network manager does not work
          It ought to be possible to use bnep0 whenever the active interface contains semicolons
          but if it aint broke dont fix it!
          Corrected formatSentReceiver to handle negative numbers resulting from offsets 
3.0.0     Modifications for Mint 18 and higher with Cinnamon 3.0 and higher
          Changes to Suspend Script to work with SystemD as well as Dbus for suspend and changes to allow immediate suspend option in box.
          Addition of version test to chose between xed for Mint 18 with Cinnamon 3.0 and gedit for earlier versions. 
3.0.2     NOTE 3.0.1 was not a separate version - it was a mechanism to overwrite a faulty zip upload of 3.0.0 to the cinnamon-spices web site
3.0.3     Corrected icon.png in applet folder which is used by Add Applets and removed incorrect icon from metadata.json
3.0.4     Increased maximum from 5000 mbytes to 100000 mbytes for totalLimit and cummulative offsets
3.0.5     Made much more use of formatSentReceived() because of increase in limits
          Removed a number of commented out blocks to do with cumulative totals and formatting.
3.0.6     Choice of units for limits and offsets to be Mbytes or Gbytes by drop down widget in settings (configuration) window
          Maximum Limits and Offsets set to 200000 Mbytes/Gbytes as appropriate
